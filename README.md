This Python code prompts the user to enter a specified number of 4-letter prompts. It then processes these prompts to find common substrings in the end of the 
previous prompt and the start of the subsequent prompt and concatenate them to form a final result.

ALGORITHM(WITHOUT AI SEARCH ALGORITHM):
1. GET THE NUMBER OF 4-LETTER PROMPTS FROM THE USER
2. CREATE THE PROMPTS AND ADD IT TO A LIST
3. IT ITEARTES THROUGH THE PROMPTS AND FINDS THE COMMON SUBSTRINGS FROM THE PREVIOUS PROMPT AND IN THE START OF THE NEXT PROMPT TO GET THE FINAL RESULT
4. ONE LIST STORES COMMON SUBSTRINGS THE OTEHR STORES THE OTHER SUBSTRINGS
5. THESE TWO LISTS ARE JOINED IN ORDER TO GET THE FINAL RESULT/STRING
6. THE JOINED STRING IS THEN PRINTED
